# HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION

***INTRODUCTION***


Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and intervention can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques.

𝐁𝐔𝐒𝐈𝐍𝐄𝐒𝐒 𝐂𝐀𝐒𝐄 :

BASE ON GIVEN FEATURE AND MEASUREMENT PREDICT WHETHER PATIENT WILL HAVE HEART DISEASE OR NOT.

**DATASET**:


The dataset used in this project is the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which includes various health parameters such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc.


**PROJECT STRUCTURE**:


*data: Contains the dataset and any data preprocessing scripts.

*notebooks: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling.

*src: Source code for the project, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training scripts.

*README.md: Project documentation.

**DATA PREPROCESSING**:

* Handled missing values through imputation.
  
* Standardized and normalized the features.
  
* Performed feature engineering to extract meaningful insights.

**MACHINE LEARNING MODELS**

We experimented with multiple algorithms to find the best model for predicting heart disease:

* Logistic Regression

* Decision Trees

* Random Forest

* Gradient Boosting

* Support vector machine
  
**RESULTS**

Achieved an accuracy of 83% with the Random Forest classifier.

Identified key features contributing to heart disease risk.
